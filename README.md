# About
#### Welcome to the world of Load Balancer!

This is a simple web server which demos the use of <b>Flask</b> along with a <b>load balancer</b>. The environment is virtually created using <b>Docker</b>.

> app runs at `http://localhost/`
> 
> mongo-express is available at `http://localhost:8081`


If you pass `user_id` as a query paramter in the `GET` request to `/`, the server responds with the associated `user_key` which it fetches from a mongodb database along with the port number of the service responding, otherwise it simply shows which Flask app is serving your request. The load is balanced within 3 flask servers using nginx.

#### Pre-Requisite:
Machine should have Docker installed in it.

# Deploy & Run
One-time setup:
1. Set mongo db credentials that you would want in two separate environment variables using following commands (where `username` and `password` are values that you want to set):  
    a. `export mongo_user=username`  
    b. `export mongo_pass=password`
    Note: sample commands specifically for mac & linux systems 
2. Mount containers: Open root project directory  
        run `docker-compose up --build`
3. SSH in mongo's docker container: Open a separate terminal in root project directory  
        run `docker exec -it mongo /bin/bash` 
4. Here, create database using dunp:
        In the docker container terminal from step 3,  
        run `mongorestore --db myusers dump/myusers -u <username> -p <password> --authenticationDatabase admin`
5. Run following commands to create role and authentication for `myusers` table:  
```
. mongo -u username -p password --authenticationDatabase admin
. use myusers  
. db.createUser({ user: "username", pwd: "password", roles: [{ role: "readWrite", db: "myusers" }] }) 
```
**Note:** use same username-password that you created in ENV variables  

6. run `exit` to exit docker container shell  
7. Proceed with testing (refer to Test section)

---
For every time you want to run / restart containers:
1. Open terminal in project's root directory and run following commands 
2. `docker-compose build`
3. `docker-compose up`  
or alternatively: `docker-compose up --build`

To stop running services: Press `Ctrl + Z` and RUN `docker-compose stop`

## Test
On Browser:
- To test load balancer working, you can keep reloading the home page at http://localhost/ and you'll see the page being served from a different flask server everytime.
- To test `user_key` retrieval, pass in the `user_id` as a query parameter to '/' route eg `http://localhost/?user_id=1` will return `one@5cdb5896d7c8` as the key. The response will also contain the port of the flask server that is responding.
- If a `user_id` is passed which does not exist in the database, the server returns an error with 400 status code
- If the request does not contain the `user_id` param, it will return port
- user_id from 1 to 7 are available in database and more can be added through mongo-express

Additionally, you can use a REST API client like Postman to `GET` request `http://localhost/` with the `user_id` query param

#### Other useful commands
> - `docker-compose ps`
> - `mongodump --db myusers -u username -p password --authenticationDatabase admin`

# Steps of Development
> 1. Carefully went over the requirement and understood different aspects of the assignment. 
> 2. Created virtual environment for flask app along with its folder structure and created requirements.txt file so that it can be served through uWSGI
> 3. Created wsgi config & basic flask routing at '/' and tested working through `flask run`
> 4. Dockerized flask and nginx
> 5. Added code to spin off 3 flask servers via docker containers
> 6. Added load balancer code to share load among the three flask servers
> 7. Added mongo integration and included dump restore functionality in Readme to ease deployment
> 8. Implemented query params handling to query mongodb and fetch appropraite key

---

#### TODOs / Future Improvements: 
```
 - Handle server side exceptions eg when Internal Server Error happens due to authentication failed
 - Change Dockerfile code to use ENV variable to set .ini file & implement through single docker file
 - Explore if it can be done through single app.ini file
 - Can add checks for DDoS and block IPs
```
